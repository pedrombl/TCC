\section{A Framework for Scalability Testing}
\label{framework}

Our Scalability Testing Framework aims at assisting the scalability analyzer, the person who tests the scalability, to verify the scalability of an application. Based on the research presented in the last section, we conclude that the tester must apply the following steps to assess a system scalability. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose the variables of the problem complexity, the performance, and the architecture.
\item Define the functions of the complexity size of the problem, performance metric, and the architecture capability.
\item Choose initial values for these variables.
\item Execute the application with these initial values for obtaining the initial value of the performance metric.
\item Execute multiple times with the same process and collect the performance metric for each execution.
\item Analyze the performance metric.
\end{enumerate}

Since we do not want to restrict which type of scalability the tester will analyze, we choose to develop a framework with which steps 1 to 3 could be made without limitations.
To support the scalability analyzer, the Scalability Testing Framework automates steps 4 and 5, which are a repetitive process. It also assists the analysis of the obtained performance metric (Step 6).

The framework is developed in Java and it may be used with it or with other languages that run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and can be used with Java Annotations, such as Scala.

The scalability analyzer needs to execute the same process multiple times by changing only the variables that define the complexity size of the problem and the architecture capability. To support that, the framework provides two Java Annotations \emph{@ScalabilityTest} and \emph{@Scale} that gives the ability to the scalability analyzer to execute steps 4 and 5. The tester must only specify a method that describes the execution and the variables that need to change for each execution.

\lstset{caption={Scalability test method template},label=MethodTemplate}
\begin{lstlisting}
@ScalabilityTest(scalabilityFunction=<ScalabilityFunction.class>, steps=<Integer>)
public List<Number> methodName(@Scale Number parameterScale, Object parameter) {
	//execution process
	return performanceMetrics;
}

\end{lstlisting}

A template of the method that is executed by the framework is shown in Listing \ref{MethodTemplate}. The annotation \emph{@ScalabilityTest} has two parameters: \emph{scalabilityFunction} and \emph{steps}. The \emph{steps} parameter defines how many times the method will be executed, we call each execution as a \emph{step}.

With the \emph{scalabilityFunction} parameter, the scalability analyzer specifies how the method parameters with the annotation \emph{@Scale} will increase for each step. The parameter specified is a class that extends the ScalabilityFunction class. The classes available are \emph{LinearIncrease}, \emph{ExponentialIncrease}, and \emph{QuadraticIncrease}, which are described with more details below.

The framework collects the performance metric of each step as a list of values. After each execution, it calculates the mean and the standard deviation of these lists to plot them in a graph.

\subsection{Example}

Suppose that we developed a web service which is located in a cloud environment and we want to verify its \emph{load scalability}. Therefore, we choose the number of requests per second to be the complexity size of the problem function, the number of nodes which the web service is running upon as an architecture capability, and the average response time as the performance metric. Code \ref{TestExample} shows an example of scalability test in this case.
\lstset{caption={Scalability test example},label=TestExample}
\begin{lstlisting}
@ScalabilityTest(scalabilityFunction=LinearIncrease.class, steps=5)
public List<Long> scalabilityTest(@Scale int requests, @Scale int numberNodes) {
	List<Long> resposeTimes = new List<Long>();
	instatiateNodes(numberNodes); // Change the number of nodes
	responseTimes = makeRequestsPerSecond(rps);//Returns a list of response times
	return responseTimes;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Line 1 specifies that this method is a scalability test that must be executed 5 times and that the parameters with the \emph{@Scale} annotation (Line 2) should increase linearly. 

In Line 4, we call a method that will change the number of nodes where the web service is deployed. If we increase the number of nodes, we improve the architecture capability. Then, in Line 5, we call a function that makes a number of requests per second to the web service and returns the response time of each execution.

The framework will execute the scalability test with the call presented in the Listing \ref{ScalabilityTestCall}. The object \emph{wsScalabilityTest} is the one where the test is described, the string \emph{"scalabilityTest"} is the name of the scalability test, and the \emph{1000} and \emph{1}  integers are the initial values of the test parameters.
\lstset{caption={Scalability test call},label=ScalabilityTestCall}
\begin{lstlisting}
ScalabilityReport report;
report = ScalabilityTesting.run(wsScalabilityTest, "scalabilityTest", 1000, 1);
\end{lstlisting}

\caption{Execution of the scalability test in example \ref{ScalabilityTestCall}}
\label{sequenceDiagramExample}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The Sequence Diagram in Figure \ref{sequenceDiagramExample} shows how the example above will be executed by the framework. It will execute 5 times, increasing the test parameters linearly, collecting the results, and calculating the mean and the standard deviation for each execution step. After the execution, the framework returns a \emph{ScalabilityReport} object, which contains the information about the execution.

Listing \ref{GraphPlotExample} shows how to use the report to plot a graph using the \emph{ScalabilityReportChart}. Since it can plot more than one scalability test for comparisons, it receives a list of reports. The scalability analyzer can also specify the label for the performance metric axis, which is by default \emph{"Performance metric"}. Figure \ref{graphIllustration} shows a graph illustration of the example above.

\lstset{caption={Graph plotting code example},label=GraphPlotExample}
\begin{lstlisting}
ScalabilityReportChart chart = new ScalabilityReportChart();
List<ScalabilityReport> reports = new ArrayList<ScalabilityReport>();
reports.add(report);
chart.createChart(reports, "average response time (ms)");
\end{lstlisting}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Architecture}
Our Scalability Testing Framework is composed of three main packages, the first related to the framework hot spots, where the annotations is located, the second used to interpret the annotations and execute the scalability tests, and the third to show the scalability testing report to the scalability analyzer. The class diagram is presented in Figure \ref{classDiagram}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Framework Hot Spots: Annotations and Scalability Increase Functions}
A hot spot of a framework is a place of the architecture where the developer can add or modified desired functionalities to adapt the application. In this case, for instance, the test specification is a content that the tester will add to execute the framework. Our Scalability Testing Framework has main principal hot spots.  The first hot spots the framework provides are the two Java Annotations, \emph{@ScalabilityTest} and \emph{@Scale}.

The \emph{@Scale} annotation is a parameter annotation. It must be located before the specification of the parameter and the parameter type. The parameters with this annotation will be increased by the framework in each execution step.

The \emph{@ScalabilityTest} annotation is a method annotation, which means that it must be used for methods and it is located right above the method that describes a scalability test. It has two parameters: \emph{steps} describes how many iterations the framework will perform to execute the test; \emph{scalabilityFunction} describes how the method parameters with the \emph{@Scale} annotation will increase in each step. It is defined by a class that extends the \emph{ScalabilityFunction} class.

This is the second major hot spot of the framework. There are, already, three ScalabilityFunction classes implemented:
\begin{description}
\item[LinearIncrease] increases the parameters linearly. Thus, a parameter with initial value $x$ will be $2x$ in the second step and $nx$ in step $n$.
\item[ExponetialIncrease] increases the parameters exponentially. The parameter with initial value $x$ will be $x \times 2$ in the second step and $x \times 2^n$ in step $n$.
\item[QuadraticIncrease] increases the parameters quadratically. The parameter with initial value $x$ will be $x \times 2$ in the second step and $x \times (n-1)^2$ in step $n$.
\end{description}

However, the scalability analyzer can develop other scalability function for a particular case if needed. The class must extend the \emph{ScalabilityFunction} class which has a method that defines how a parameter will increase. It receives two integers with the last value used and the initial value and must return a new value.

\subsubsection{ScalabilityTest Interpreters}
The \emph{ScalabilityTesting} class is called by the scalability analyzer to execute the scalability tests. It executes the scalability test based on the parameters specified in the annotations \emph{@ScalabilityTest} and \emph{@Scale}. It uses the \emph{ScalabilityTestMethod} class, which interprets the annotations of the scalability tests, to collect information about the test methods.

For each step, a \emph{ScalabilityStepReport} is instantiated with the results. With the support of the JDK Commons Math package, it calculates the mean and the stardard deviation of the performance metrics.

After the execution, the \emph{ScalabilityTesting} class instantiates a \emph{ScalabilityReport} that has a list of \emph{ScalaiblityStepReport}. This class can be used by the scalability analyzer to a plot a graph to analyze the results.

\subsubsection{Scalability Tests Graph}
The scalability analyzer can plot the result of one or more scalability tests with their \emph{ScalabilityReport} using the \emph{ScalabilityReportChart}. This class uses the \emph{XYChart} class, that has the procedure to plot the graph with the support of the JFreeChart package\footnote{http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/}] .


\subsection{Implementation}

The framework was developed in Java since it belongs to the Rehearsal Framework, which is in Java. We developed it using Test-Driven Development (TDD), described in the introduction, with the support of the JUnit Framework\footnote{http://www.junit.org/} to specify and run the tests.

The development used the Eclipse IDE\footnote{http://www.eclipse.org/} with the support of the EclEmma\footnote{http://www.eclemma.org/} and Eclipse Metrics\footnote{http://eclipse-metrics.sourceforge.net/} plugins. The first one is a Java code coverage tool to verify the coverage of the tests in the code. Our Scalability Testing Framework has 100\% of test coverage. The second one calculates some metrics of the code, such as cohesion metrics, which helped us develop a code with quality.\\

The Scalability Testing Framework uses two third-party libraries:
\begin{description}
\item[JFreeChart\footnote{http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/}] to plot the performance metric graphs. It depends on the JCommon library. Both are licensed under the terms of GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). 
\item[Math Commons\footnote{http://commons.apache.org/math/}] to calculate statistical values of the performance values returned by the scalability tests. It is licensed under the terms of the Apache License.
\end{description}

The project used the Strategy Design pattern~[\cite{GOF1995}] in the implementation of the functionality that increases the parameters in each step. The Strategy structure is presented in Figure \ref{strategyStructure}. 

The \emph{ScalabilityTesting} class, which executes the tests, collects a \emph{ScalabilityFunction} class, the strategy class, and increases the test parameters without the knowledge of which strategy is being used. The concrete strategy classes can be the \emph{LinearIncrease}, \emph{ExponentialIncrease}, \emph{QuadraticIncrease}, and another class developed by the scalability analyzer that extends the \emph{ScalabilityFunciton} class. As we can observe, the structure of the classes described is equivalent to the Strategy Structure.
